# Daily Planner

An easy way to keep your day organized

## Description

I created a daily planner for the workday using vanilla JS, HTML, CSS, and JQuery. This planner allows you to add tasks to each hour of the day and save them to local storage. Additionally, it is easy to keep track of which task is next as the colors of the day will changed based on the time (past is gray, present red, and future green).

## Getting Started

Simply click into the hour you want to add the task, start typing, and click the save button to save the task
